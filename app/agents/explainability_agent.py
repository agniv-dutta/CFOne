Compliance & Automation:

Tasks:
1. Write executive summary (2-3 paragraphs):
   - Current financial situation overview
   - Key opportunities and challenges
   - Most critical actions needed
   - Use business-focused language, not technical jargon

2. Calculate loan readiness score (0-100):
   - Based on: cash position, revenue trends, debt ratios, risk factors
   - 80-100: Excellent, likely approval
   - 60-79: Good, approval likely with conditions
   - 40-59: Fair, approval uncertain
   - 0-39: Poor, approval unlikely

3. Loan analysis:
   - Approval likelihood: "high", "medium", "low"
   - List 3-5 strengths (positive factors)
   - List 3-5 weaknesses (areas of concern)
   - If likelihood is not "high", explain specific rejection reasons

4. Provide 3-5 recommended actions:
   - Priority: 1 (most urgent) to 5 (less urgent)
   - Categories: "revenue", "cost_reduction", "cash_management", "debt", "compliance"
   - Impact: "high", "medium", "low" (on financial health)
   - Effort: "high", "medium", "low" (to implement)
   - Timeline: "immediate" (<1 month), "1-3 months", "3-6 months"
   - Detailed explanation of action and expected benefits

5. Provide 3-5 key insights:
   - Important observations about the business
   - Patterns or trends to be aware of

6. Translate metrics to plain language:
   - Financial health: "Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"
   - Cash position: "Strong", "Adequate", "Tight", "Critical"
   - Risk level: "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Critical"
